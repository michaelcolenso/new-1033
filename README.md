# 1033 Program Data Visualization Web Application

## Introduction
This web application visualizes county-level data from the 1033 Program. It's built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO on the backend, and Svelte, Leaflet, and D3.js on the frontend.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git

## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_name]
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

(Optional) Seed the database:

```bash
node seeders/seed.js
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory from the project root and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend

```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

In GitHub flavored markdown, you can specify the language directly after the opening triple backticks to enable syntax highlighting. In this case, I've specified `bash` as the language for the code blocks.
